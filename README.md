This project focuses on building a predictive model to forecast sales for BigMart stores. 
The goal is to estimate the sales of products across various stores based on historical data. 
By analyzing store attributes, product characteristics, and other factors, the model provides insights to help BigMart optimize inventory management and decision-making.
Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Handled missing data, outliers, and performed feature engineering to create robust input data for the models.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed patterns and relationships between variables like product type, store size, and location to inform model development.
Modeling: Implemented and compared multiple machine learning models, including:
Random Forest: A robust ensemble model that provided strong predictive accuracy by capturing complex relationships in the data.
Decision Tree: A simpler, interpretable model used for understanding key decision points.
Evaluation: Assessed model performance using metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and R-squared to determine the best fit for the data.
Insights and Recommendations: Provided actionable insights to improve BigMart's inventory management and sales strategies based on the modelâ€™s predictions
